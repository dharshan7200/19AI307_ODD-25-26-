## QUESTION:

Create a class Course with attributes code, title, credits.

## AIM:

To create a class Course with attributes code, title, credits.

## ALGORITHM :
```
1.	Start the program.
2.Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.Create two Course objects: c1 and c2.
4.Read the course code, title, and credits for each Course object from the user and store them in object variables.
5.Call the printDetails() method for both objects to display the stored course details.
6.Stop the program.
```

}

class prog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        Course c1 = new Course();
        c1.code = sc.next();
        c1.title = sc.next();
        c1.credits = sc.nextInt();

        Course c2 = new Course();
        c2.code = sc.next();
        c2.title = sc.next();
        c2.credits = sc.nextInt();

        c1.printDetails();
        c2.printDetails();

        sc.close();
    }
}
